# BrainMuffin Homepage Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Implement a compelling homepage for BrainMuffin that clearly communicates the value proposition and drives conversions.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Structure (Highest Priority)
- [ ] Update `src/pages/index.astro` with main sections
- [ ] Enhance `src/components/Hero.astro`
- [ ] Create `src/components/Benefits.astro`

### Phase 2: Content Sections
- [ ] Work Showcase component
- [ ] Testimonials section  
- [ ] CTA footer section

### Phase 3: Enhancements
- [ ] Interactive before/after slider
- [ ] Smooth scroll animations
- [ ] Mobile optimizations

## Component Breakdown

### Hero Component (`Hero.astro`)
- Punchy headline & subheadline
- Background image/video
- Primary/secondary CTAs
- Mobile-responsive layout

### Benefits Component (`Benefits.astro`)
- 3-4 benefit cards with:
  - Icons/illustrations
  - Concise benefit statements
  - Supporting details

## Content Requirements
- [ ] Hero background visual
- [ ] 3-5 work examples with before/after
- [ ] Client testimonials (2-3)
- [ ] Benefit icons/illustrations
- [ ] Client logos (if available)

## Technical Considerations
- Use Astro's image optimization
- Implement GSAP/Framer Motion for animations
- Ensure full mobile responsiveness
- Add smooth scroll behavior

## Open Questions
- Should we use existing placeholder images or source new ones?
- Do we have client testimonials available?
- Should we implement the interactive slider in Phase 1 or 2?

## Pre-Launch Checklist

### Content & Accuracy
- [ ] **Proofread all text:** Check for typos, grammar errors, and clarity on all pages (Home, About, Services, Contact, Blog index/posts).
- [ ] **Verify all links:** Ensure internal and external links work correctly and point to the intended destinations.
- [ ] **Check images & media:** Confirm all images load correctly, have appropriate alt text, and are optimized. Verify placeholder images are replaced.
- [ ] **Review forms:** Ensure contact forms (and any others) submit correctly and data is received as expected. Check validation messages.
- [ ] **Confirm branding:** Verify logo usage, color palette, and fonts are consistent with brand guidelines.
- [ ] **Check Footer:** Ensure copyright year is current and all footer links (privacy policy, terms, etc., if applicable) are present and correct.

### Functionality & UX
- [ ] **Test navigation:** Ensure main navigation, breadcrumbs (if any), and internal links work smoothly across all pages.
- [ ] **Interactive elements:** Test any sliders, accordions, modals, or other interactive components.
- [ ] **Cross-browser testing:** Check appearance and functionality in major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- [ ] **Cross-device testing:** Verify layout, readability, and usability on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). Check for responsive breakpoints.

### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] **Run performance audit:** Use tools like Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights to check load times and identify bottlenecks.
- [ ] **Image optimization:** Double-check that all images are appropriately sized and compressed.
- [ ] **Code minification:** Ensure CSS and JS are minified for production build. (Astro usually handles this).

### SEO & Accessibility
- [ ] **Review Title Tags & Meta Descriptions:** Ensure each page has a unique, descriptive title tag and meta description.
- [ ] **Check Header Tags (H1, H2, etc.):** Verify logical heading structure on each page.
- [ ] **Alt Text for Images:** Confirm all meaningful images have descriptive alt text.
- [ ] **Basic Accessibility Check:** Run an automated accessibility checker (like WAVE or Axe) and address major issues (e.g., color contrast, keyboard navigation).
- [ ] **Favicon:** Ensure the favicon is correctly configured and displays in browser tabs.
- [ ] **Robots.txt:** Verify `robots.txt` allows indexing of necessary pages.
- [ ] **Sitemap:** Ensure `sitemap.xml` (or equivalent, like `rss.xml.js` for the blog) is generated correctly.

### Deployment & Final Steps
- [ ] **Run production build:** Execute `npm run build` (or equivalent) and check for errors.
- [ ] **Configure hosting/deployment:** Ensure deployment settings (e.g., in Wrangler for Cloudflare Pages) are correct for the production environment.
- [ ] **Set up analytics:** Confirm analytics tracking (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible) is installed and working.
- [ ] **Domain configuration:** Verify DNS records point correctly to the live server.
- [ ] **HTTPS:** Ensure SSL certificate is installed and site forces HTTPS.
- [ ] **Final backup:** Take a final backup of the codebase before deployment.
